# Slack Messaging Bot
# My first slack messaging bot build using Nodejs.
This is a Node.js CLI-based Slack Messaging Bot. I developed this bot for an internship assignment that was assigned to me recently.It uses the Slack API to send, schedule, and retreive messages from a Slack channel.
All this bot can do for now is send messages, schedule messages and retrieve any messages present in the channel it is added to or has access to.
## Features

- Send messages to a Slack channel
- Schedule messages to be sent later
- Retrieve recent messages from a channel
- Uses `.env` file for securely storing API tokens

## Technologies used

- Nodejs
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
- dotenv (for environment variable management)
- Slack API

P.S : I will provide details later.
